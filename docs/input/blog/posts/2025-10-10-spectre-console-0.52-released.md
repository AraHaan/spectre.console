Version `0.52.0` of Spectre.Console has been released!

Exciting things are happening. Weâ€™ve merged support for my love child, OpenCli, in this release. That means you can now pass the parameter `--help-dump-opencli` to your application to get an [OpenCli](https://opencli.org) description dumped to stdout.

## What's Changed

* Add OpenCLI integration to Spectre.Console.Cli by [@patriksvensson](https://github.com/patriksvensson) in [#1909](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/pull/1909)
* Fix OPENCLI_VISIBILITY_INTERNAL to DefineConstants concat by [@devlead](https://github.com/devlead) in [#1912](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/pull/1912)
